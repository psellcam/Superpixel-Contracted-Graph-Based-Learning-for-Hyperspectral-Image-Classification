This document details the code relating to Superpixel Contracted Graph Based Hyperspectral Classification

main.py is the main code

processing_data.py,setup.py,lcmr_functions.py,data_analysis.py,classification_functions.py are little files for pre/post-processing
HMS.py details the superpixel approach
graph_clean.py contains the Local and Global Consistency Graph Based Algorithm

There are several cython file extensions which are coded to make the files run faster, please make sure to have cython installed.
